                        A Story From The Farm Yard Two roosters were fighting fiercely to be the king of the farm yard. One finally gained advantage and the other surrendered.<br /><br />The loosing rooster slunk away and hid itself in a quiet corner. The winner flew up to a high wall, flapped its wings and crowed its victory, as loud as it could.<br /><br />Suddenly, an eagle came sailing through the air and carried it off, with its talons. The loosing rooster immediately came out of its corner and ruled the farm yard from then on.   <br /><br />Read the following text to answer questions number 1 to 3<br /><br />1.What is the main idea of paragraph 3?<br />2.from the text we know that...<br />3.what can we learn from the story?<br />

                        True Friends<br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />Moral of the Story- A true friend in need is a friend indeed.<br />The Mouse Deer And The Tiger (cerita kancil dan harimau)<br />

                        Unlike many Jewish holidays, Hanukkah (also known as the Festival of Lights) is not mentioned in the Bible. The historical events upon which the celebration is based are recorded in Maccabees I and II, two books contained within a later collection of writings known as the Apocrypha. Although Hanukkah is considered a “minor” Jewish festival, today it ranks—along with Passover and Purim—as one of the most beloved Jewish family holidays.<br /><br />In the year 168 B.C.E., the Syrian tyrant Antiochus Epiphanes sent his soldiers to Jerusalem. The Syrians desecrated the Temple, the holiest place for Jews at that time.  Antiochus also abolished Judaism, outlawing the observance of Shabbat and the Festivals, as well as circumcision.  Altars and idols were set up for the worship of Greek gods and he offered Jews two options:  conversion or death.<br /><br />On the 25th day of the Hebrew month of Kislev in 168 B.C.E., the Temple was renamed for the Greek god Zeus. A resistance movement— led by a priestly family known as the Hasmoneans, or Maccabees—developed against the cruelty of Antiochus. The head of the family was Mattathias, an elderly man.  His son, Judah, became the chief strategist and military leader of the resistance. Though outnumbered, Judah Maccabee and his fighters miraculously won two major battles, routing the Syrians decisively.<br /><br />Although historians debate the causes and outcomes of the war in which Judah Maccabee and his followers defeated the Syrian armies of Antiochus, there is no doubt that Hanukkah evokes stirring images of Jewish valor against overwhelming odds. Other themes rooted in the observance of the holiday include the refusal to submit to the religious demands of an empire practicing idolatry, the struggle against total assimilation into Hellenistic culture and loss of Jewish identity, and the fight for Jewish political autonomy and self-determination.<br /><br />Hanukkah, which means “dedication,” is the festival that commemorates the purification and rededication of the Temple following the defilement caused by the Greeks during their occupation of that holy place. Today, the holiday reminds Jews to rededicate themselves to stand against forces that would destroy Judaism and to keep alive the flame of Jewish religion, culture, and peoplehood so that it may be passed on to the next generation.<br /><br />Originally, the eight-day holiday was intended to parallel the eight-day festival of Sukkot. The Books of the Maccabees made no mention of the legend concerning a small jar of oil that unexpectedly lasted for eight days.  Only centuries after the Maccabees’ defeat of the Syrians did the story of the jar of oil—which has come to be a part of Hanukkah—appear in the Talmud.<br /><br />According to the legend, when the Maccabees entered the Temple and began to reclaim it from the Greeks, they immediately relit the ner tamid (eternal light), which burned constantly in the Temple and has a parallel in our synagogues to this day. In the Temple, they found a single jar of oil, which was sufficient for only one day. The messenger who was sent to secure additional oil took eight days to complete his mission, and miraculously, the single jar of oil continued to burn until his return. The rabbis of the Talmud attributed the eight days of Hanukkah to the miracle of this single jar of oil.<br /><br />Although the practice of lighting the menorah was common throughout much of the 19th century, North American Jews tended to neglect most of the other traditions and practices associated with the holiday.  By the 1920s, however, Jews increasingly added gift-giving to their Hanukkah celebrations, prompting Christians to refer to Hanukkah as the "Jewish Christmas."<br /><br />Like many aspects of Jewish religious practice, the transformation of Hanukkah was linked to the growth of North American Jewry within its unique environment. The elevation of Hanukkah to a major holiday was the result of Jews acculturating themselves to a North America that was overwhelmingly Christian in population and symbols.<br /><br />Although Hanukkah had become an important holiday among North American Jews by the 1920s, it would be incorrect to regard it as an imitation of Christmas with an emphasis on the exchange of presents. Rather, North American Jews use this holiday as a celebration of family, reinforcing Jewish identity in a place whose population may be overwhelmingly Christian but in which Jews feel at home. Hanukkah, therefore, is a means for North American Jews to feel a kinship with their neighbors, while simultaneously asserting their Jewish distinctiveness.<br />

                        The Smartest Animal <br /><br /><br />
Once there was a farmer from Laos. Every morning and every evening, he ploughed his field with his buffalo.

<br />

One day, a tiger saw the farmer and his 
buffalo working in the field. The tiger was very surprised to see a big 
animal listening to a small animal. The tiger wanted to know more about 
the big animal and the small animal.

<br /> 



After the man went home,
 the tiger spoke to the buffalo; “you are so big and strong. Why do you 
do everything the man tells you?” The buffalo answered; “oh, the man is 
very intelligent”.

<br />

The tiger asked; “can you tell me how intelligent he is?”. “No, I can’t tell you”, said the buffalo; “but you can ask him”

<br />

So the next day the tiger asked to the 
man; “Can I see your intelligence?”. But the man answered; “it at home”.
 “Can you go and get it?” asked the tiger. “Yes” said the man; “but I am
 afraid you will kill my buffalo when I am gone. Can I tie you to a 
tree?”

<br />

After the man tied the tiger to the 
tree, he didn’t go home to get his intelligence. He took his plough and 
hit the tiger. Then he said; “Now you know about my intelligence even 
you haven’t seen it.

                        <p>My Shit Day
</p><p>
</p><p>          When I woke up on Monday, I was very surprised to see that the clock was 6:30. I immediately got up and took a quick shower. After taking a shower, I ate breakfast, then left for school on public transportation. When I got off the angkot, I opened the bag to take money. Immediately I remembered that today was Monday. The time for the flag ceremony was held. Apparently I forgot to put a hat in the bag. Finally with confidence, I walked to school.
</p><p>
</p><p>          Arriving at school, it turned out that the students had gathered in the field. The ceremony almost begins. I also rushed to the ceremony field and the back of the ceremony. When the ceremony began, the principal immediately gave a briefing on the school rules. Suddenly a teacher came to check the neatness of his students. And unfortunately, I don't wear a hat. Me and my friends who violate the rules must line up separately with students who do not violate the rules.
</p><p>
</p><p>          After the ceremony was over, children who violated the rules of conduct could not leave the field. Because it will be punished. We were told to clean the ceremony field. One of my teachers watched us. Half an hour passed, suddenly my teacher called us to line up again. It turned out that the penalty for clearing the field had been completed. We feel relieved. I thought this sentence was over. But our teacher added us more punishment. We were told to write "I will not repeat this action again" to 100x. And it must be finished at the first break. How surprised I was after hearing those words. Inwardly saying that only because of a school hat, I was punished like this.
</p><p>
</p><p>          Luckily, the first lesson was empty because the teacher did not enter. I used it to write the sentence given by the teacher. My job is complete right at break time. Q collected it with friends. I feel relieved. From that experience, I always bring my hat into the bag.

The other elephants<br />heard this. They began to laugh and made rude noises<br />with their trunks. “We’re so big and tall, but you’re<br />so small. You’re nothing at all,” said one of the big<br />elephants.<br />Mantu looked up at the huge elephant with a<br />mishievous glint in his eye. “You’re so tall and can<br />see far away. We can see what is happening down<br />here in the jungle. In fact, we would be the worst to see<br />any slithering snakes that may be a danger. “After<br />hearing the word snakes, the elephants screeched<br />and off they gwents thundering in fright.<br />“Did I say there were snakes?” giggled Mantu. “No,<br />I don’t think so,” smiled Opie.

            <br />                                Queen of Arabia and Three Sheiks

<br />

<br />Maura, who like to be thought of as the 
most beautiful and powerful queen of Arabia, had many suitors. One by 
one she discarded them, until her list was reduced to just three sheiks.
 The three sheiks were all equally young and handsome. They were also 
rich and strong. It was very hard to decide who would be the best of 
them.

<br /> 



One evening, Maura disguised herself and
 went to the camp of the three sheiks. As they were about to have 
dinner, Maura asked them for something to eat. The first gave her some 
left over food. The second Sheik gave her some unappetizing camel’s 
tail. The third sheik, who was called Hakim, offered her some of the 
most tender and tasty meat. After dinner, the disguised queen left the 
sheik’s camp.

<br />

The following day, the queen invited the
 three sheiks to dinner at her palace. She ordered her servant to give 
each one exactly what they had given her the evening before. Hakim, who 
received a plate of delicious meat, refused to eat it if the other two 
sheiks could not share it with him.

<br />

This Sheik Hakim’s act finally convinced
 Queen Maura that he was the man for her. “Without question, Hakim is 
the most generous of you” she announced her choice to the sheiks. “So it
 is Hakim I will marry”.

One evening, some fishermen passed by the pond and saw the fish. “This pond is full of fish”, they told each other excitedly. “we have never fished here before. We must come back tomorrow morning with our nets and catch these fish!” So saying, the fishermen left. When the eldest of the three fish heard this, he was troubled. He called the other fish together and said, “Did you hear what the fishermen said? We must leave this pond now. The fishermen will return tomorrow and kill us all!” The second of the three fish agreed. “You are right”, he said. “We must leave this pond now.” But the youngest fish laughed. “You are worrying without reason”, he said. “We have lived in this pond all our lives, and no fisherman has ever come here. Why should these men return? I am not going anywhere – my luck will keep me safe”. The eldest of the fish left the pond that very evening with his entire family. The second fish saw the fishermen coming in the distance early next morning and left the pond at once with all his family. The third fish refused to leave even then. The fishermen arrived and caught all the fish left in the pond. The third fish‟s luck did not help him – he was caught and killed.<br /><br /><br />
